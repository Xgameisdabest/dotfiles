## About
my i3 config, up to date as I change my shits

you may see there are some configs and dependencies for hyprland and sway, this is bc im too lazy to make a git repo for those so i decided to put them here. Also, it is highly recommend to use i3wm as it is the most up to date and also the main focus of this repo.

if you have any problems trying to understand my English then heres the **tldr**: 
- **This whole config is mainly for i3wm, not for hyprland and sway.**

> [!NOTE]
> Only work on Debian based distros, might as well change it on your own if you use Arch or Red Hat based OS.
